## **Privacy Statement**

This privacy statement was last updated March 28, 2019

Emogi Technologies, Inc. (“Emogi” “we” “us” or “our”) provides development and data tools to messaging services and applications with messaging functionality (“Application”) through our website, mobile services, and software (our “Services”). Depending on the type of Service selected by the developer of the Application you are using, we may collect certain information about you.

You are probably reading this because an Application you downloaded uses our Services and directed you to read this Privacy Statement so you can understand how we collect, use and share information about you when you use the Application, our Services, or otherwise interact with us, as well as what your choices are regarding the collection, use and sharing of your information.

By using the Application, you are agreeing to this Privacy Statement. If you do not agree, then do not use the Application. We may change this Privacy Statement from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the statement and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Statement whenever you access the Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.

This Privacy Statement does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including those of the developer of the Application you are using. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any third-party services you access.

### Information We Collect:

We use technologies such as Software Development Kits (SDKs) or Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to collect information about you as described below. We use these technologies to recognize your device and to track your activities in the Applications and in other websites. These technologies work by storing a line of code in the Application that resides in your mobile device and synchronizes information back and forth between your mobile device and our servers. When you remove the Application from your mobile device, this line of code will also be removed. We may also collect information when you fill out a form, communicate with us via third-party social media sites or otherwise communicate with us.

We may collect and store the following information with respect to your use of our Services:
