    their most authentic voice to communicate with their closest friends and
    family.

    trying to break through the clutter and get intimate with consumers on the
    big social platforms, like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, but those networks
    are 'super crowded.'" Emogi is a "relatively untapped platform for brands"

  blurb: >-
    AI-powered assistants like chatbots have already changed the way we handle
    routine tasks. However, the limitations are clear: these conversations
    follow a script of pre-programmed responses. Patrick Perrin, PhD, Chief
    Scientist, Head of AI and Research at Emogi, discusses how Conversational AI
    will take things a step further by creating helpful responses, tailored not
    only to tone, but also to situations. AI will become our conversational
    side-kick, enhancing our understanding of human conversations and
    transforming the way we interact through messaging.
