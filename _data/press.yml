    72 trillion messages were sent across messaging platforms in 2018. In 2019,

    where people are not only sharing the most,  but also where people are using
    their most authentic voice to communicate with their closest friends and
    family.

    Campaign US catches up with Travis Montaque, Founder & CEO of Emogi, and
    Brian Dolan, Sr. Brand Manager, RB Health Equity on the first Mucinex cold
    and flu activation on Emogi's platform. According ot Dolan, "Every brand is
    trying to break through the clutter and get intimate with consumers on the
    big social platforms, like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, but those networks
    are 'super crowded.'" Emogi is a "relatively untapped platform for brands"
    and provides major brands like Mucinex the opportunity to go beyond
    traditional advertising tactics by connecting with consumers directly though
    messaging with branded content.
